# finalproject

Please write your initial proposal for your final project in this README document. What type of project is it? 

- Package?
    - data package
    - analysis package
- Shiny app? 
- Something else?

Where do you expect to find data? Do you need help finding data? What question will your project answer or purpose will it solve?

STAT 360 Group Project Proposal

Project Outline
Our final project deliverable will be an R Shiny app that will allow the user to view an interactive map of the Minneapolis-St. Paul area public transportation. The application will have certain parameters that will be used to generate the most efficient (defined in methodology) public transportation lines based on a chosen “train stop.” The train stops will be non-traditional stops that consist of fast food restaurants and other stores. This map is not intended to be the future direction of the MN Metro Transit organization, but rather will put into perspective the amount of market share these chains have.

Data Collection
Data collection will be self-collected using Google Maps as a reference. We will search for "train stop" locations, save them, and pull address/location values for each chain. The chains will we use are still under discussion within our group, but as an example, the data may consist of addresses from McDonald’s, Caribou Coffee, Speedways, Taco Bell, and TCF Banks. 

Methodology
Our methodology for creating the R Shiny App will consist of mainly three packages: Tidyverse to perform any data collection and manipulation, ggmap to visualize maps of the twin cities area, and Shiny to develop our application.
